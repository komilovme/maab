# Answers to BI & Python Questions

# 1. Why do you think companies analyze large volumes of data?
answer1 = """
Companies analyze large volumes of data to make better decisions, understand customer behavior,
identify trends, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and stay competitive in the market.
Data helps them predict future outcomes instead of guessing.
"""

# 2. How can Python help instead of manual Excel work?
answer2 = """
Python can automatically process, clean, sort, and analyze large datasets much faster than Excel.
It can handle millions of rows, automate repetitive tasks, reduce human errors, and run complex
calculations using libraries like pandas and numpy.
"""

# 3. How would you analyze 10,000 daily transactions?
answer3 = """
I would store the data in a database or CSV file, then use Python to:
- Clean incorrect or missing data
- Group transactions by product, date, or customer
- Calculate total sales, average purchase value, and trends
- Visualize results using charts
""""

# 4. Python usage in BI processes
answer4 = """
Python is useful in BI for:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data analysis and aggregation
- Data visualization (charts, dashboards)
- Automation of reports
- Forecasting and predictive analysis
"""

# 5. Comparing company profit year by year
answer5 = """
Using Python, profits can be stored in a dataset and analyzed with pandas.
We can group data by year, calculate total profit per year, and visualize
the comparison using line charts or bar charts.
"""

# 6. Difficulties without Python
answer6 = """
Without Python, working with large datasets would be slow and inefficient.
Manual work increases errors, automation is limited, advanced analysis is hard,
and handling big data in Excel can cause performance issues or crashes.
